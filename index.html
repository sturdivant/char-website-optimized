                <p>The Galactic Orphaned Droid Trust is dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming droids left abandoned across the galaxy. From the Outer Rim’s forgotten scrapyards to derelict starships adrift in the void, our mission is to ensure that no droid is left without purpose, companionship, or proper oiling.</p>
                <p>We believe every unit, from astromechs to protocol models, deserves the chance to beep, whistle, or translate again in a safe, loving environment. With your support, we can provide refurbished parts, memory core counseling, and new homes for these mechanical companions, giving them the second life they were built for.</p>
