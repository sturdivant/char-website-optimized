** Assignments 1 - 4 will be a continuation of the personal page you did last week.
## Assignment 1: What is CSS? Linking CSS to HTML

**Task:**  
1. Create a new file called `style.css`.
2. Link your `style.css` file to your existing `index.html` webpage using the `<link>` tag inside the `<head>` section.

## Assignment 2: Selectors, Properties, and Values

**Task:**  
1. In your `style.css`, use different selectors to style elements on your page:
   - Use an element selector to change the color of all `<h1>` headings.
   - Use a class selector to style a group of elements (e.g., add a `.highlight` class and give it a background color).
   - Use an ID selector to style one unique element (e.g., `#main-title` for your main heading).

## Assignment 3: Colors, Fonts, Margins, Padding, and Borders

**Task:**  
1. Add styles to change the colors and fonts of your headings and paragraphs.
2. Add margins and padding to at least one section or list.
3. Add a border to an image or a container element.
4. Try at least two different font families on your page.

## Assignment 4: CSS Classes vs. IDs

**Task:**  
1. Add at least two classes and one ID to your HTML elements.
2. Use CSS to style each class and ID differently.
   - For example: `.section-header` for subheadings, `.card` for hobby list items, `#main-image` for the main image.
